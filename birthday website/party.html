      "Dear Doctor paapa, seeing you smile today while cutting your cake filled my heart with so much joy. May your days always be as sweet and bright as this moment.As a friend, I get to know your name when we are children and never seen you but we travel together as the years go by and wanted to speak with you initially,But I had a fear of approaching you initially,Once we get connected I feel like I have known you for ages,Your kindness and warmth are truly inspiring,Remember the moment that we throw off the shackles,From then you have a special place in my heart and I really want to accept the fact that I never followed your words in school days but I tried my level best to follow your words,Now you are with me to guide me to be a better person,But in school days we have a lot of restrictions.If it goes the other way,I will be a better person and grow along with you and I assure you that my presence with you would make a difference in our mental strength.I really proud to be your brother and friend and You have given me a space to be myself which a girl who never spoke to boys in school would never give to anyone blindly but you gave me I valued it more than my self respect .You never judged me by my behaviour
      and healed me with your words and actions.I swear that your hardwork and dedication will take you to great heights in your career and life. Keep shining bright and never forget that you are loved and appreciated by so many people around you.On this special day I promise you that I will stay connected to you beyond restrictions and whatever the situation is,and I will protect you as my eyes and keep away from the difficulties,So much to share with you,I just a call away whatever the situation is,Finally Happy birthday once again, Doctor paapa!"
